### MFPAgent - Liquidity/ListingLogic Contracts Documentation

The System comprises `MFPAgent`, `MFPListingLogic`, `CCLiquidityLogic`. Together they form the factory suite of an AMM Orderbook Hybrid on the EVM.

## CCLiquidityLogic Contract

The liquidity logic inherits `SSLiquidityTemplate` and is used by the `MFPAgent` to deploy new liquidity contracts tied to listing contracts for a unique `tokenA` and `tokenB` pair.

## Additional Details

- **Relisting Behavior**:
  - **Purpose**: `relistToken` and `relistNative` allow the original lister to replace a token pair listing with a new one to update routers, Uniswap V2 pair, or other configurations.
  - **Replacement**:
    - Deploys new `MFPListingTemplate` and `SSLiquidityTemplate` contracts with a new `listingId`.
    - Updates `getListing`, `allListings`, `queryByAddress`, `getLister`, and `listingsByLister` with new listing address and lister.
    - Old listing remains in `allListings` but is no longer referenced in `getListing` for the token pair.
  - **User Interaction with Old Listings**:
    - Old listings remain accessible via `CCOrderRouter` functions (e.g., `createTokenBuyOrder`, `createTokenSellOrder`, `clearSingleOrder`, `executeLongPayouts`, `executeShortPayouts`, `settleLongLiquid`, `settleShortLiquid`) because `isValidListing` validates against `allListings`.
    - Users can interact with old listings by explicitly providing their addresses, allowing order creation, cancellation, or payout execution, provided sufficient liquidity and valid order states.
    - New orders for the token pair will use the new listing address via `getListing[tokenA][tokenB]`, potentially causing confusion if users interact with the old listing unintentionally.
  - **Event**: Emits `ListingRelisted` with old and new listing addresses, token pair, new `listingId`, and lister.
- **Globalizer Integration**:
  - The `globalizerAddress` is set in new listing contracts via `setGlobalizerAddress` during `_initializeListing` if defined, enabling integration with a separate globalizer contract for order and liquidity management.
- **Lister Tracking**:
  - `msg.sender` is stored as the lister in `listToken` and `listNative` via `getLister` and `listingsByLister`.
  - `transferLister` allows the current lister to transfer control to a new address, updating `getLister` and `listingsByLister`.
  - `getListingsByLister` provides paginated access to a lister’s listing IDs.
