# **Premise**
A succinct and homogenized version of `MF-PairingFoundry.md` and `MF-FixedFoundry.md`. 

# **General**
The system is made up of (4) contracts, `MFP-Listing`, `MFP-Liquidity`, `MFP-Router`, `MFP-Agent`. 


## **MFP-Listing**

### **Data**
- routerAddress 

Stores the valid router address that can call `transact` or `update`. 

- Listing Data (9) 

Contract Name : (string),
Token-A address : (address),
Token-B address : (address),
Price : (uint256),
Liquidity Address : (address),
xBalance : (uint256),
yBalance : (uint256),
xVolume : (uint256),
yVolume : (uint256),

`Token-$ address` can be `0` indicating [NATIVE]. 

- Order Slots (14)

Slot Index: (uint256),
Maker Address: (address),
Recipient Address: (address),
Order type: (bool),
Token-A Contract: (address),
Token-B Contract: (address),
Max Price: (uint256),
Min Price: (uint256),
Principal:  (`TOKEN-0` or `TOKEN-1`),
Pending:  (`TOKEN-0` or `TOKEN-1`),
Filled: (uint256)
Created at: (uint256),
Last Settled Price: (uint256),
Order ID: (uint256),
Status: (uint256),

`Recipient Address` is where the settlement is sent, this is necessary for Multihop. 

`Status` is `Pending`, `Settled`, or `Cancelled`, Cancelled orders can No longer be settled. 

`Last Settled Price` is updated after every settlement.

`Filled` stores how much of the destination token the maker has received, is updated after every settlement - partial or whole. 


- price
  
Price is calculated as; 

`Token-0 Balance / Token-1 Balance`


If price can not be acquired then default price is lowest divisible unit of Token-1 

Whenever price is updated, the prior price becomes historical, this updates all historical data as well. 

- historicalSellVolume 

Stores entries for previous yVolume appended with index + timestamp.

- historicalBuyVolume 

Stores entries for previous xVolume appended with an index + timestamp.

- historicalPrice
  
Stores entries for previous price appended with an index + timestamp. 

- historicalMarketCap
  
Stores entries for previous mcap appended with index + timestamp. 

- Order Index
  
Stores the index numbers of all order slots, indexes are malleable - addressable and adjust their number when a slot is cleared. 

- Maker Index
  
A separate set of indexing exists for individual maker addresses. 

- Order ID
  
All orders are tagged on a third scheme that is rigid and does not change number. 

### **Functions**

- QueryOrderByIndex

This function returns the order details of a target order slot by its order index, if there is no order then the query fails. 

- queryOrderByID 

This function returns the full details of an order by its ID.

Once an order is cancelled or filled, this will still return the full details and order status. 

- QueryOrderByMaker

Updates price on listing contract 
Updates xFees balance data on liquidity contract 
Updates balances on listing contract 
Note differences in call/query functions if the transacted token is `NATIVE`. 
*
Updates agent contract's validation balances and liquids.

- createSellOrder

Same as `createBuyOrder` but with sell order details, spends token-B of the listing, updates yVolume and yFees. 

- clearSingleOrder

Notes the order pending amount 
Sets the order status to `cancelled`
Sends the pending amount to the `Recipient Address` 
Can only be called by the maker 
*
Updates validation balances and liquids

- clearOrders 

Similar to `clearSingleOrder` but searches for up to (100) pending orders a caller has and executes `clearSingleOrder` on all of them.
*
Updates validation balances and liquids
   
- settleOrders 

Requires a Listing Address 
Updates Price on listing contract 
Searches for up to (100) pending orders
Calculates their x and y pending 
Obtains the available x and y balances 
Settles as many orders that can be settled wholly 
Settles as many orders that can only be settled partially 

Buys are settled as; 

```
Order amount / price = pre output

yLiquidity - pre output = impact-y

x-liquid / impact-y = impact price

order amount / impact price = settlement-y
```

Sells are settled as;

```
Order amount * price = pre output

xLiquidity - pre output = impact-x

impact-x / y-liquid = impact price

order amount * impact price = settlement-x
```

Settlement cannot use >50% of the available liquidity 
Only settles orders whose max/min prices are met
Updates balances on listing contract
Updates Price on listing contract again
Note that all numbers in all formulas need to use some form of safe math to account for decimals
Note that all decimals should be normalized to 18
*
Updates agent validation balances and liquids

- settleLiquid 

Similar to `settleOrders` but uses x and y liquids to settle pending orders
Moves settled x principal to x liquid and vice versa.  

- depositX 

Requires a Listing Address
Finds Liquidity Address on Listing Address 
Moves Token-0 from the caller into the Liquidity Contract 

Calculates and stores Ratio as; 

`x-deposit / impact x-amount = x-ratio`

Calculates and stores Ratio as; 

`y-deposit / impact y-amount = y-ratio`

Fetches yVolume from Listing Address. 

- withdrawX 

Requires Listing Address
Requires withdrawal amount

`Current x-Liquidity * x-ratio = pending output`

Output cannot be greater than xAllocation
Default to nominal xAllocation as output
if output is lesser than allocation then calculate;

```
initial deposit - pending amount = deficit

deficit / price = compensation-y
```

Pays pending amount
Attempts to pay compensation-y from y-liquid or y-liquid and y-balance if y-liquid is insufficient 
If both are insufficient then withdrawal fails
Optional `withLoss` boolean
If `withLoss` true then pay withdrawal with any amount of compensation
Updates ratio using new allocation balance; 

`x-allocation / impact x-amount = x-ratio`

When a withdrawal leaves `0` allocation then the liquidity slot is erased and the liquidity index is updated
Forfeits unclaimed fees if slot is erased. 
*
Updates validation balances and liquids

- withdrawY 

Same as withdrawX but deals with Y-Type liquidity slots and their details.

Calculates output; 

`Current y-Liquidity * y-ratio = pending output`

contributed volume / 100 * 0.05 = fees accrued

user Liquidity / total Liquidity = Liquidity contribution

fees accrued * liquidity contribution = output amount
```

Resets dVolume to current (x or y)Volume
Output amount cannot be greater than available fees, if greater then only pay available fees. 

- transferLiquidity 

Requires a user liquidity index number

# **Examples**
E1 : A token with the price of `0.25` implies that the token is worth 0.25 `TOKEN-0`. If a user puts an order to spend 250 `TOKEN-0` to buy the token, the exchange calculates; 250 / 0.25 = 1000. If they were selling (1000) `TOKEN-1` then the equation is; (1000) * 0.25 = 250. 

E2 : If a listing address has 500 `TOKEN-0` and 100 `TOKEN-1`, 500 / 100 = 5, this means the price is 5 `TOKEN-0'. If a user was buying 250 `TOKEN-0` worth of `TOKEN-1` this is; 250 / 5 = 50. Whereas if they were to sell 50 `TOKEN-1` it would be; 50 * 5 = 250.  

E3 : Assuming a token has a price of `2` and a yBalance with (100) `TOKEN-1`, while a user's order has 300 `TOKEN-0` pending, the contract settles them 50 `TOKEN-1` and updates the order to show that they have 200  `TOKEN-0` pending, while reducing the yBalance to (50), and increasing the xBalance by `100`. This is Partial settlement and also applies to settleLiquid. 

E4 : If an order with 200 `TOKEN-0` was settled for (100) `TOKEN-1` using `settleOrders`, this `TOKEN-0` amount becomes xBalance, but with settleLiquid this becomes xLiquid, vice versa for `TOKEN-1` with yBalance and yLiquid. 

E5 : If an order with 200 `TOKEN-0` was stored in xBalance, and was then settled using settleLiquid, this deducts the stored amount from xBalance and adds it to xLiquid, while deducting the respective `TOKEN-1` amount from yLiquid to settle the associated orders. Vice versa for `TOKEN-1` with yBalance and yLiquid. 

E6 & E7 : We don't talk about E6 & 7 

E8 : If a user attempted to sell (1000) `TOKEN-1` at a price of `1` but liquidity fees are active, their actual settlement will be subtracted by 0.05% equalling; 999.5, the 0.5 `TOKEN-0` fee is sent to the Liquidity contract and recorded under `yFees`. 
Orders settled partially bill fees on each settlement. 

If the user attempts to buy (1000) `TOKEN-1` in the same vein, fees are subtracted from the order before it is placed. The actual order would have a principal of 999.5 `TOKEN-0`. 

E9 : A buy order is made for a token. At the time the order is made the price is 5, their impact is 1%, once the order is placed the price goes up to 5.025, then once the order is settled the impact price is 5.05, this represents the post settlement price and is the price the user is settled at. 

With the price now at 5.05, when the user attempts to sell; if the impact is 1% again then the price they would be settled at is 5 or less and not 5.05.
 
The buyer makes no profit from trading with themselves and in fact loses due to fees or unforseen changes in balance. 

E10 : Same as E9 but after the first user buys; any number of users then also buy the token, driving the price up by 10%, now the price is 5.55. When the user attempts to sell; the price they sell at is 5.4945 due to changes that occur when their principal is added to the listing contract and pending amount is paid. Thus they made profit at the expense of the other buyer(s).
