# **Premise**
A succinct and homogenized version of `MF-PairingFoundry.md` and `MF-FixedFoundry.md`. 

# **General**
The system is made up of (4) contracts, `MFP-Listing`, `MFP-Liquidity`, `MFP-Router`, `MFP-Agent`. 

---

## **MFP-Listing**

### **Data**
- routerAddress 

Stores the valid router address that can call `transact` or `update`. 

- Listing Data (6) 

Separate Mappings
Contract Name : (string), 
Token-A address : (address), 
Token-B address : (address), 
Price : (uint256), 
Liquidity Address : (address), 

Struct for Volume and Balance data, 
Same Mapping
xBalance : (uint256), 
yBalance : (uint256),
xVolume : (uint256), 
yVolume : (uint256), 

`Token-$ address` can be `0` indicating [NATIVE]. 

- Buy Order Slots (9)

A struct for buy orders,

Maker Address: (address),
Recipient Address: (address),
Max Price: (uint256),
Min Price: (uint256),
Principal:  (`TOKEN-0`),
Pending:  (`TOKEN-0`),
Filled : (uint256), 
Order ID: (uint256),
Status: (uint256),

`Recipient Address` is where the settlement is sent, this is necessary for Multihop. 

`Filled` stores how much of the destination token the maker has received, is updated after every settlement - partial or whole. 

`Status` is `Pending`, `Filled`, or `Cancelled` (1, 2, 3), Cancelled orders can No longer be settled. 


- Sell Order Slots (9)

Same as "Buy Order Slots" but for sell orders. But `Principal` and `Pending` are in Token-1. 


- price 

Price is calculated as; 

`Token-0 Balance / Token-1 Balance`


If price can not be acquired then default price is lowest divisible unit of Token-1 

Whenever price is updated, the prior price becomes historical, this updates all historical data as well. 



- historicalSellVolume 

A mapping that stores entries for previous yVolume appended with index + timestamp. Is queryable by index. Is added to after every order or settlement. 

- historicalBuyVolume 

A mapping that stores entries for previous xVolume appended with index + timestamp. Is queryable by index. Is added to after every order or settlement. 

- historicalPrice

A mapping that stores entries for previous price entries appended with an index + timestamp. Is queryable by index. Is added to after every order or settlement. 

- historyCount

An array that stores the total number of historicalPrice, historicalBuyVolume, buy orders, sell orders, and historicalSellVolume entries, Is added to after every order or settlement. 

- makerOrders 

An array that stores the order IDs for a given maker address, is added to or subtracted from after every order or settlement by or to an address. 

- buyOrders

A mapping that stores the details of all buy orders, is public and queryable by order ID. 

- Order ID 

All orders are tagged on a rigid indexing scheme that only increments, does not close gaps, is rigid and does not change number. Is queryable, returns the full details of an order by ID number. 

- dayStart

A mapping that stores the index number for historical various data entries, is updated whenever the previous data entry of a given array or mapping is from the previous day, while the newer entry is from a new day. Router proceeds to update `dayStart` with the latest indexes for the new day. 

### **Functions**

- update (Router only)

Changes the details of up to (100) arrays or mappings, either creating - updating or clearing entries for orders, historical data etc, 

- transact (Router only)

Used by the router to move `TOKEN-0` or `TOKEN-1` out of the Listing contract to a recipient. 

- setRouter (ownerOnly)

Determines the router address. 

- queryYield 

Has a boolean param for determining "x" or "y" yield. Calculates and returns the real yield rate for fees collected. First gets the latest historical (x or y)volume entry and attempts to find a volume entry from dayStart. Then calculates;

``` 
Latest (x or y)volume height - oldest 24hr (x or y)volume height = total 24hr (x or y)volume 

Total 24hr (x or y)Volume / 100 * 0.05 = total (x or y)Fees 

Total (x or y)Fees / total (x or y)Liquid * 100 = daily (x or y)Yield 

Daily (x or y)Yield * 365 = (x or y)APY
``` 

This function fetches (x or y)Liquid data from liquidity contract.



## **MFP-Liquidity**

### **Data**

- routerAddress 

Stores the valid router address that can call `transact` or `update`. 


- Liquidity Details

Separate mapping, 
Listing : (address), 

Same Mapping 
xLiquid : (uint256), 
yLiquid : (uint256), 
xFees : (uint256), 
yFees : (uint256), 



- xLiquidity Slots 

Struct for xLiquidity slots, 
Same Mapping
depositor : (address),
xRatio : (uint256),
xAllocation : (uint256),
dVolume : (uint256),
index : (uint256),


- yLiquidity Slots 

Same as "xLiquidity Slots", but for yLiquidity. 

`Ratios` store how much of the overall liquidity the depositor owns, is calculated during deposit from the router. 

- Liquidity Index

A mapping that stores the index numbers of all liquidity slots, indexes are queryable and fixed, they do not fill gaps or decrease in number. 

- User Index 

An array that stores the liquidity index numbers for each address, is updated after every user deposit or withdrawal. Is queryable. 

### **Functions**
- update (Router only)

Changes the details of up to (100) arrays or mappings, either creating - updating or clearing entries for liquidity slots, historical data etc,  

- transact (Router only)

Used by the router to move `TOKEN-0` or `TOKEN-1` out of the liquidity contract to a recipient. 

- setRouter (ownerOnly)

Determines the router address. 


 
## **MFP-Router**

### **Data**

Requires Listing Address 
Takes Order Details
Checks decimals
Normalizes input to 18 decimals 
Checks `balanceOf` of the target listing address for token-A
Notes balance
Calls transferFrom for the order amount from the caller to the target listing 
Subtracts 0.05% from order amount to xFees 
Checks balanceOf at the listing address for token-A
Notes new listing contract balance 
Subtracts new listing balance with old balance 
Difference becomes order's principal 
Sets order details into a new order slot
Updates xVolume, adds order amount
Updates xFees balance data on liquidity contract 
Note differences in call/query functions if the transacted token is `NATIVE`. 


- createSellOrder

Same as `createBuyOrder` but with sell order details, spends token-B of the listing, updates yVolume and yFees. 

- clearSingleOrder

Requires orderID param, 
Notes the order pending amount,
Sets the order status to `cancelled`,
Sends the pending amount to the `Recipient Address`,
Can only be called by the maker,
If there are insufficient tokens units to cover the cancellation then function fails. 


- clearOrders 

Similar to `clearSingleOrder` but searches for up to (100) pending orders a caller has and executes `clearSingleOrder` on all of them.


   
- settleBuyOrders 

Requires a Listing Address,
Updates Price on listing contract,
Searches for up to (100) pending buy orders,
Calculates their settlement amount,
Obtains the available y balance,
Settles as many orders that can be settled wholly,
Settles as many orders that can only be settled partially,

Buys are settled as; 

`Order amount / price = pre output
yLiquidity - pre output = impact-y
 x-liquid / impact-y = impact price`

`order amount / impact price = settlement-y`

- settleSellOrders 

Similar to `settleBuyOrders` but uses x balance to settle pending sell orders. 

Sells are settled as;

`Order amount * price = pre output
xLiquidity - pre output = impact-x
 impact-x / y-liquid = impact price`

`order amount * impact price = settlement-x`

Settlement cannot use >50% of the available liquidity,
Only settles orders whose max/min prices are met,
Updates Price on listing contract again,
Note that all numbers in all formulas need to use some form of safe math to account for decimals
Note that all decimals should be normalized to 18. 


- settleBuyLiquid 

Similar to `settleBuyOrders` but uses y liquids to settle pending buy orders. 
Moves settled principal to xLiquid. 

- settleSellLiquid

Similar to `settleSellOrders` but uses x liquids to settle pending sell orders,
Moves settled principal to y liquid. 


- xDeposit

Requires a Listing Address,
Finds Liquidity Address on Listing Address ,

Calculates and stores Ratio as; 

`x-deposit / impact x-amount = x-ratio`

Fetches xVolume from Listing Address,
Saves dVolume,
Stores allocation,
Updates Liquidity index,
Note differences in call/query functions if the transacted token is `NATIVE`. 

- yDeposit

Similar to xDeposit but ... 

Calculates and stores Ratio as; 

`y-deposit / impact y-amount = y-ratio`

Fetches yVolume from Listing Address. 



- xWithdraw

Requires Listing Address
Requires withdrawal amount
Requires index
Finds Liquidity Address on Listing Address
Fetches `x-liquidity`, `x-ratio`, `xAllocation`, `price`
Pays requested amount of xLiquid has enough token units, else fails. 

When a withdrawal leaves `0` allocation then the liquidity slot is erased and the liquidity index is updated,
Forfeits unclaimed fees if slot is erased. 



- yWithdraw

Same as xWithdraw but deals with Y-Type liquidity slots and their details.


- claimFees 

Requires user liquidity index number
fetches current x or y volume depending on liquidity slot type 
Fetches total x or y liquidity depending on liquidity slot type
fetches dVolume

Calculates; 

`Current (x or y)Volume - (x or y)Volume at deposit = contributed volume`

`contributed volume / 100 * 0.05 = fees accrued`

`user Liquidity / total Liquidity = Liquidity contribution` 

`fees accrued * liquidity contribution = output amount` 


Resets dVolume to current (x or y)Volume
Output amount cannot be greater than available fees, if greater then only pay available fees. 



- transferLiquidity 

Requires a user liquidity index number,
Changes the `depositor` of stated index to a new, address,
Stating `0` sets this to the burn address,
Can only be called by the current depositor. 


 
- setAgent

Listing Address ;  (address),
Listed Token(s) ;  (address, address), 
Balances ; (xBalance, yBalance),
Liquids : (xLiquid, yLiquid), 
Index : (uint256), 

Each listing validation mapping is queryable by listing address or index. 

- Listing Index 

An array that stores each listing validation entry by index number and token address. Each time a token is listed the index of the listing validation is stored against the token address. Is queryable by token address. The token address for `NATIVE` is "0". Only returns the first (1000) entries, requires an incremental number param to query additional (1000). 

- listingCount 

Stores the total number of listings made. Is increased whenever a new listing is made. 

### **Functions**

- listToken 

Searches Listing validation for the exact token pair,
Cannot list existing pair,
Requires a Token-0 and Token-1,

Creates a new listing and liquidity contract,
Verifies contracts,
Writes listing contract details,
Writes liquidity contract details,



# **Examples**
E1 : A listing with the price of `0.25` implies that the Token-1 is worth 0.25 `TOKEN-0`. If a user puts an order to spend 250 `TOKEN-0` to buy the Token-1, the exchange calculates; 250 / 0.25 = 1000. If they were selling (1000) `TOKEN-1` then the equation is; (1000) * 0.25 = 250. 

E2 : If a listing address has 500 `TOKEN-0` and 100 `TOKEN-1`, 500 / 100 = 5, this means the price is 5 `TOKEN-0'. If a user was buying 250 `TOKEN-0` worth of `TOKEN-1` this is; 250 / 5 = 50. Whereas if they were to sell 50 `TOKEN-1` it would be; 50 * 5 = 250.  

E3 : Assuming a token has a price of `2` and a yBalance with (100) `TOKEN-1`, while a user's order has 300 `TOKEN-0` pending, the contract settles them 50 `TOKEN-1` and updates the order to show that they have 200  `TOKEN-0` pending, while reducing the yBalance to (50), and increasing the xBalance by `100`. This is Partial settlement and also applies to settleLiquid. 

E4 : If an order with 200 `TOKEN-0` was settled for (100) `TOKEN-1` using `settleOrders`, this `TOKEN-0` amount becomes xBalance, but with settleLiquid this becomes xLiquid, vice versa for `TOKEN-1` with yBalance and yLiquid. 

E5 : If an order with 200 `TOKEN-0` was stored in xBalance, and was then settled using settleLiquid, this deducts the stored amount from xBalance and adds it to xLiquid, while deducting the respective `TOKEN-1` amount from yLiquid to settle the associated orders. Vice versa for `TOKEN-1` with yBalance and yLiquid. 

E6 & E7 : We don't talk about E6 & 7 

E8 : If a user attempted to sell (1000) `TOKEN-1` at a price of `1` but liquidity fees are active, their actual order will be subtracted by 0.05% equalling; 999.5, the 0.5 `TOKEN-0` fee is sent to the Liquidity contract and recorded under `yFees`. 

If the user attempts to buy (1000) `TOKEN-1` in the same vein, fees are subtracted from the order. The actual order would have a principal of 999.5 `TOKEN-0`. 

E9 : A buy order is made for a token. At the time the order is made the price is 5, their impact is 1%, once the order is placed the price goes up to 5.025, then once the order is settled the impact price is 5.05, this represents the post settlement price and is the price the user is settled at. 

With the price now at 5.05, when the user attempts to sell; if the impact is 1% again then the price they would be settled at is 5 or less and not 5.05.
 
The buyer makes no profit from trading with themselves and in fact loses due to fees or unforseen changes in balance. 

E10 : Same as E9 but after the first user buys; any number of users then also buy the token, driving the price up by 10%, now the price is 5.55. When the user attempts to sell; the price they sell at is 5.4945 due to changes that occur when their principal is added to the listing contract and pending amount is paid. Thus they made profit at the expense of the other buyer(s).
