/// Dispenser Contract ///
A simple contract for acquiring DOHL without slippage. 

! Functions ! 
- Convert 
Fetches the current POL/USD price from the set Chainlink oracle and calculates; 

POL Amount * POL/USD price = DOHL Output 

The "POL Amount" is an amount of POL which must be deducted from the user's address to perform the conversion. 
This function takes the user's stated POL and pays out DOHL at the acquired rate. 

The acquired POL is then sent to the LP address. 

Calls 'Rebase' at the DOHL contract address. 

- setOracle
Determines the oracle address. 

- setLP 
Determines the POL/DOHL liquidity pool address.

1d. Header Subtitle 
A transparent panel that reads; "A highly scalable and accurately price stable synthetic stablecoin making use of "LP Rebase".
The token achieves a price of $1 by fetching the POL/USD price from a Chainlink oracle and rebases a target QuickSwap liquidity pool (that holds wPOL/DOHL) based on the LP Rebase formula. 

$DOHL does not require collateral to remain stable, however, users may encounter slippage depending on how much they intend to trade and how much liquidity is available. 

Users may profit by providing liquidity.  This is because the rebase function increases or reduces the balance of all Liquidity Providers depending on demand. 

$DOHL takes a 0.05% fee on every external transfer, fees are distributed to Peng NFT holders via Marker DAO. 

$DOHL is tradable on CFAMM DEXs like QuickSwap and is intended as the base asset on Dexhune-P and Shock Space."
